"""
Adapters that normalize each scan type's native result JSON into the common
finding-dict shape render.py renders - so render_summary_comment /
render_inline_comment don't change per scan type, only what feeds them does.

Loader selection is explicit by scan type (LOADERS_BY_SCANTYPE), matching
what `aspm-cli scan <type>` actually wrote (results.json for sast/sca,
results_json.json for iac - see scan/sast.py, scan/iac.py, scan/trivy_runner.py).
Falls back to filename sniffing (detect_loader) only when no scan type is
given, for callers working from AccuKnox-labeled files (<label>-<TYPE>-*.json)
instead of this CLI's own local scan output.

`secret` findings come from one of two engines (scan/secret.py): TruffleHog
(default, JSON-per-line to results.jsonl) or Gitleaks (results.json, SARIF).
load_findings_secret() picks the loader by extension, matching
SecretScanner.result_file's own .jsonl/.json split - no separate flag needed.

CAVEAT: unlike the checkov/trivy/sast loaders (each verified against this
CLI's own real output), the two secret loaders below are built against
TruffleHog v3's and SARIF 2.1.0's public documented schemas, not a live
sample - no docker/network access was available to generate one. Both specs
are stable and versioned, so this isn't a blind guess, but run once against
real findings before trusting it in production (same caveat generate_
remediation.py already carries for its own untested LLM call).

        {"SourceMetadata": {"Data": {<SourceType>: {"file", "line", ...}}},
         "DetectorName", "Verified", "Raw", "Redacted", ...}

    <SourceType> depends on how trufflehog was invoked, not a fixed key -
    "Git" for the documented real command (docs/onprem-setup-guide.md:
    `secret --command "git file://." --container-mode`), "Filesystem" for a
    bare `filesystem .`, etc. Confirmed against the CSPM backend's own
    TruffleHogParser (source/parsers/trufflehog.py), which handles the same
    ambiguity by taking whichever single key is present under Data - exactly
    one is, since that's however this run was invoked. "file"/"line" exist
    under all of them (Git/Github/Gitlab/Huggingface/Filesystem all carry
    those two; S3/Gcs carry other path fields as a rarer case not scanned
    from a git repo, so not handled here).

    Severity is TruffleHog's own `Verified` flag, not a native tier - it has
    none. Verified=true means the credential was confirmed *live* against
    the provider's API (the most urgent class of finding this integration
    can produce) -> CRITICAL. Verified=false is a pattern match only (could
    be a false positive, a rotated/dead key, or real) -> HIGH, for manual
    triage. This policy (not a fact about TruffleHog) matches the CSPM
    backend parser's own risk_factor exactly: RISKS.HIGH, RISKS.CRITICAL if
    verified.

    Never renders `Raw` (the actual secret value) into a PR comment - only
    the already-masked `Redacted` field. `code` is left empty on purpose so
    render_inline_comment never prints a code block that could re-leak the
